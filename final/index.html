        March Madness' Round of 64 is a hyperbolic chaos chamber. Is there order hidden in the data?

<p>
Few events in the sports world can rival the initial round of March Madness. When 64 lucky teams are pitted against each other over the course of 48 hours, bedlam almost always ensues. Across the last five tournaments, this chaos has extended to every corner of the field, and made victims of teams that were previously all but worry-free in the opening round. </p>
<p>
In the tournament, teams are seeded from 1 to 16, the lower number corresponding with the higher-quality team. Excluding the pre-tournament play-in round, four teams are assigned to each seed line, for a total of 64. Matchups are determined likewise, with the powerhouse 1 seeds taking on 16 seeds that snuck in by winning a lower-ranked conference, 2 seeds matching up with 15 seeds, and so on. The opening round can be perilous for squads seeded near the middle of the fray, with 6, 7, and 8 seeds running up against opponents roughly equal to them in rating and skill. 1 and 2 seeds, then, are almost always safe. Key word: almost. </p>
<p>
Since seeding began in the 1985 tournament, 1 seeds are 150-2 in the Round of 64, while 2 seeds are 141-11. These numbers seem to suggest that lower seed triumphs are few and far between, but those figures are deceptive. Both of the 16 seed wins, along with three of the eight 15 seed wins, have come in the last five tournaments. Starting with the 2018 tournament, there has clearly been a shift (be it ever so slight) toward parity in the opening round, with 1 and 2 seeds no longer enjoying the free wins that they so often did. Why this change occurred is a complex question for another day and another article. In this exercise, I’ll attempt to identify how it happened, by looking for patterns in the data that may point toward a specific set of circumstances that makes an upset more likely. </p>

  <b><u>THE UPSETS</u></b></p>
<p>
  As previously mentioned, our sample contains every tournament across the last five years. What I’m defining as a “massive upset” for the purposes of this exercise is a 1 or 2 seed losing to a 16 or 15 in the <b>first round</b>. Several of the teams in this sample went on to pull off even more upsets after their first victory, but for the sake of simplicity, first round only. The teams in the sample that pulled off wins are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
(16) Fairleigh Dickinson over (1) Purdue in 2023</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
(15) Princeton over (2) Arizona in 2023</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
(15) Saint Peter’s over (2) Kentucky in 2022</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
(15) Oral Roberts over (2) Ohio State in 2021</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
(16) UMBC over (1) Virginia in 2018</p>
<p> 
The manner in which those five squads pulled off those upsets varied wildly. As a result, this exercise will divide the upsets into the three most notable trends among either the teams that win or the teams that lose. All of this data, by the way, is from the men’s college basketball section of SportsReference.com.</p>
<p>
  Onto the trends!</p>

TREND I: LOW SEEDS WHO SHOOT THREES </p>

    To be clear, this isn’t low seeds who <i>make</i> threes - just those that take them. Across the 40-team sample, three of the top five teams in three-pointers attempted during their respective regular seasons pulled off upsets. 2018 UMBC paced the field with 940 takes, with 2021 Oral Roberts at third and 2023 Fairleigh Dickinson at fifth. 2023 Princeton sneaks into the top 15 in the sample, with 2022 Saint Peter’s standing as an outlier at 37th (as a warning, none of these stats come without outliers. We’ll get to why later). The reason a counting stat like this would be so indicative of an upset is actually quite simple - relying on a shot like the three-pointer to generate a disproportionate share of your offensive output gives your scoring a wildly high variance, with the chance to either fall flat or ride hot shooting to a miraculous win. Across the last five years, the trend is clear: fortune favors the bold. Speaking of which…</p>

<br>
<p class="section"> TREND II: HIGH SEEDS WHO DON’T SHOOT THREES </p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <br>
    <p>
    Again referring to attempts, not makes. The trend for this one is stark: all five upset victims fall well within the bottom half of the sample in three-point attempts, with three of them - 2022 Kentucky, 2018 Virginia, and 2021 Ohio State - in the bottom ten. This further corroborates the above hypothesis. Three-pointers induce variance, and the odds become ever more skewed when combining a lower-seeded team with a penchant for throwing caution to the wind with a higher-seeded team less equipped to keep up. This also helps to explain the Saint Peter’s outlier - despite the Peacocks finishing well within the bottom half among their peers, Kentucky, their victim, finished third-to-last in theirs. Despite the Wildcats actually still taking more threes than their opponents despite their ranking (596 to 566), Kentucky’s relative reluctance served to even the playing field enough for Saint Peter’s to have a shot.</p>

TREND III: OVERALL SHAKY HIGHER SEEDS</p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>
    The overwhelming consensus shown by the data is that the best way to reliably predict a lopsided seeding upset is by taking a good long look at the higher seed first. While metrics for the lower seeds are all over the place, the majority of the higher seeds consistently rank in the bottom half of their peers in metrics like point differential, shooting percentage, turnovers (bottom half meaning more committed), the bewilderingly ever-important three-pointers attempted, and even simply win/loss percentage.</p>

TREND IV: (NOT SO) SIMPLE RATING SYSTEM</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p><br>
    The available data doesn’t afford much in the way of advanced metrics, but it does offer a cover-all number for each team: Simple Rating System, or SRS. The calculations are a bit convoluted, but essentially, it uses points and final margins of victory and defeat to predict future outcomes between two teams. While that methodology might sound strange, it’s clearly doing something right, as three of the top ten low-seeded teams in SRS pulled off upsets, and three of the bottom ten (including two of the bottom three) top teams fell victim to one. Of course, I’d be remiss not to mention the former excludes 2023 Fairleigh Dickinson, who defeated their 1-seeded opponent despite coming in dead last in SRS among the sample, behind even a 2018 Texas Southern squad that finished their season 16-20. Remember what I said about outliers? Which brings us to…</p>

TREND V: CLOSE YOUR EYES AND POINT</p>
<p>
Syracuse University professor Eric Grode puts it this way: “upsets happen because the NCAA tournament isn't a best-of-7 or a best-of-5 or even a best-of-3 contest.” This exercise has been fruitful in identifying trends by which upsets can occur, the fact of the matter is that they are upsets for a reason. Try as you might to game the system, there are still countless other squads that rank highly in all the above metrics - 2021 Grand Canyon paced the field in SRS, 2019 North Dakota State shot threes with abandon - that couldn’t pull anything off. As much as an unsatisfying conclusion as this may be, at the end of the day, the laws of statistics take a vacation when inserted into the chaos realm that is March Madness. But isn’t that the appeal? If Fairleigh Dickinson, ranked dead last among every 15- and 16-seed in the last five years in advanced metrics, can win, who knows what else is possible?</p>
